# HumanoidArena

HumanoidArena is a humanoid manipulation and whole-body control benchmark built around teleoperation, replay, simulation evaluation, and LeRobot-compatible policy training. The repository provides the TWIST2 and SONIC control pipelines, Isaac Lab environments, data conversion utilities, and evaluation scripts used by the project.

## Repository Layout

```text
TWIST2/                 TWIST2 control, assets, checkpoints, and robot-side utilities
isaaclab_twist2_g1/     Isaac Lab tasks, replay, rerecording, and evaluation entrypoints
lerobot/                LeRobot fork/integration for training and policy serving
docs/                   Release-facing documentation and evaluation examples
```

## Getting Started

Set up the simulation and LeRobot environments first:

```bash
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/tools/setup_humanoidarena_envs.sh --dry-run
```

After reviewing the generated commands, follow [Environment setup](docs/04_environment_setup.md) for the full installation path.

For live teleoperation and recording:

```bash
cd TWIST2
bash teleop.sh
```

Then launch the simulator-side backend from the repository root:

```bash
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/run_twist2.sh
# or
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/run_sonic.sh
```

For replay:

```bash
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/run_replay_twist2.sh
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/run_replay_sonic.sh
```

## Data and Models

The git repository should contain source code, small examples, and required lightweight runtime assets. Large data and model artifacts are released separately:

| Artifact | Status | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LeRobot dataset | Released | https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Twang2026/HumanoidArenaV3.1 |
| Model checkpoints | Released | https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Twang2026/HumanoidArena_models |
| Simulation assets | Released | https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TCa_aVRmFrZs_l4wlxkqanNebvDtChNk/view?usp=sharing |
| Raw data | Released | https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Twang2026/HumanoidArena_raw |
| Multicam data | Planned | To be announced |

Download released model checkpoints from the Hugging Face model repository into any local artifact directory and keep the published folder layout:

```bash
huggingface-cli download HumanoidArena/<model-repo> \
  --local-dir /path/to/humanoidarena_checkpoints
```

Batch evaluation scripts read that directory through `MODEL_ROOT_BASE`:

```text
/path/to/humanoidarena_checkpoints/
  small/
  small_merge/
  pi/
```

Download the simulation asset package separately from the release asset link and restore it under the Isaac Lab package:

```text
isaaclab_twist2_g1/assets/
  objects/
  robots/
```

The asset package is intentionally distributed outside git and released through the simulation assets link above.

The TWIST2 ONNX checkpoints required by the current runtime are kept in git:

```text
TWIST2/assets/ckpts/twist2_1017_20k.onnx
TWIST2/assets/ckpts/twist2_1017_25k.onnx
```

## Evaluation

Batch evaluation entrypoints include:

```text
isaaclab_twist2_g1/batch_test_scripts/batch_1_test_v31_sonic.sh
isaaclab_twist2_g1/batch_test_scripts/batch_1_test_v31_twist2.sh
isaaclab_twist2_g1/batch_test_scripts/batch_1_test_v31_merage.sh
isaaclab_twist2_g1/batch_test_scripts/batch_pi05_v31_sonic.sh
isaaclab_twist2_g1/batch_test_scripts/batch_pi05_v31_twist2.sh
```

Batch/parallel evaluation reuses one Isaac Sim process per `(model, seed)` group across its repeats by default to speed up testing (`persist_sim=1`, from `test_defaults.persistent_sim: true` in `common_test_config`; override with `PERSISTENT_SIM` in the shell wrappers, or `--persistent_sim` when invoking the Python evaluator directly). Set `PERSISTENT_SIM=0` to restart Isaac Lab for every episode: slower, but each test starts from a clean environment and may perform better. See [Evaluation](docs/03_evaluation.md) for details.

The batch scripts above are the consistent entrypoints used for the eval experiments reported in the paper.

Single-checkpoint VLA evaluation:

> **Note:** The single-task scripts are mainly for debugging and quick effect checks of a single checkpoint. `persist_sim` is **not enabled** here: `run_vla_eval.sh` does not pass `--persistent_sim`, so Isaac Lab is restarted for every episode. Use the batch scripts above for evaluation experiments.

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint/pretrained_model \
EVAL_SEEDS="0 1 2" \
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/script/eval_scripts/sonic/run_vla_eval.sh

MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint/pretrained_model \
EVAL_SEEDS="0 1 2" \
bash isaaclab_twist2_g1/script/eval_scripts/twist2/run_vla_eval.sh
```

`MODEL_PATH` may also point to a checkpoint directory that contains `pretrained_model/`. For PI0.5 checkpoints, use the matching scripts under `script/eval_scripts/sonic_pi05/` or `script/eval_scripts/twist2_pi05/`.

See [Evaluation](docs/03_evaluation.md) for vision execution, semantic evaluation, and batch launch examples.

### SONIC latent VLA inference

The SONIC VLA runtime also supports policies that output SONIC encoder latents instead of the default 40-D semantic VLA command. This is intended for users who train a VLA directly on `encoder_latent` from SONIC raw recordings.

This interface is experimental and intended for testing latent-output VLA policies. It has not yet been validated for exact replay equivalence with direct replay.

Set `SONIC_VLA_ACTION_FORMAT=latent64` when launching a live VLA evaluation with `--gmt_backend sonic` and `--input_source vla`. The policy may return either a 64-D latent action, or a 66-D action where the final two values are left/right hand binary commands. For HTTP inference servers, accepted response keys are `latent64`, `latent64_chunk`, `encoder_latent`, or `encoder_latent_chunk`.

```bash
SONIC_VLA_ACTION_FORMAT=latent64 \
python isaaclab_twist2_g1/sim_main.py \
  --input_source vla \
  --gmt_backend sonic \
  --lerobot_server_url http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --sonic_decoder_path /path/to/sonic_decoder.onnx \
  --task Isaac-Move-Open-Door-G129-Dex3-Wholebody \
  --robot_type g129
```

This is a live inference interface for latent-output VLA policies. Replay remains limited to the maintained replay modes documented in [Data Pipeline](docs/02_data_pipeline.md).
